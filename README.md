# WoW Salvation - Bootstrapper Addon  

This is the addon for Salvation that you'll configure to point it to your Salvation instance, and put it in your wow clients.

Basically this addon is just a simple addon that bootstraps the system by downloading the main LUA bundle from the Salvation instance!


## Setup Guide:
Setting up the addon is pretty simple, but requires that you have an instance of Salvation running somewhere first, so go check out the main
salvation readme here if you haven't done so: https://github.com/SalvationAddon/salvation-app

### Step 1: Download the latest release of the addon
You can download the addon here: https://github.com/SalvationAddon/salvation-bootstrapper/archive/1.1.0.zip

### Step 2: Update Addon Settings
Once downloaded un-zip the file and edit the `main.lua` file.  Put in the information for your Salvation instance in the fields circled in the picture below:

api_url: This should be the domain name or IP address of the Salvation app (ie: example.glitch.com)
password: This is the password you configured previously in Salvation.

### Step 3: Put the `Salvation` folder in your addons folder
After modifying the settings, simply put the `Salvation` folder in your Addons folder and launch the game!


Enjoy!
